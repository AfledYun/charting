Trading Controller is a thing which will make your trading live. Its main purpose is to connect our charts with your trading logic. In terms of `JS`, it is an `object` which is expected to expose the specific interface. Here is a list of Controller's **methods** which Platform will expect to have.

##Required Methods 

####setHost(host)
This methods is called on initialization to pass a [[Trading Host]] to the controller.

####configFlags()
Implement this method to provide configuration flags object. The result is an object with the following keys, that can be `true`/`false`:

* supportReversePosition

    Broker supports reverse of a position.
    If it is not supported by broker, Chart will have the reverse button, but it will place a reverse order.

* supportClosePosition

    Broker supports close of a position.
    If it is not supported by broker, Chart will have the close button, but it will place a close order.

* supportReducePosition

    Broker supports changing of a position without orders.

* supportPLUpdate

    Broker provides PL for a position. If the broker calculates profit/loss by itself it should call [[plUpdate|Trading-Host#plupdatepositionid-pl]] as soon as PL is changed. Otherwise Chart will calculate PL as a difference between current trade and an average price of the position.

* supportBrackets

    Broker supports brackets (take profit and stop loss orders). If this flag is `true` the Chart will display an Edit button for positions and add `Edit position...` to the context menu of a position.

* supportMultiposition

    Supporting multiposition prevents creating default implementation for reverse position.

* supportCustomBottomWidget

    This flag can be used to change default account manager widget with a custom one.

* showQuantityInsteadOfAmount

	This flag can be used to change "Amount" to "Quantity" in the order dialog

* supportDOME

    This flag enables DOM widget. If `supportLevel2Data` is `false` only `last price` and orders will be shown.

* supportLevel2Data

    Level2 data is used for DOM widget. `subscribeDepth` and `unsubscribeDepth` should be implemented.
    
* supportStopLimitOrders

    This flag adds stop-limit orders type to the order dialog.

####positions : [Deferred](https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
####orders : [Deferred](https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
####executions(symbol) : [Deferred](https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
These methods are called by the Chart to request positions/orders/executions and display them on a chart.
You should return the appropriate lists of [[positions|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#position]], [[orders|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order]] or [[executions|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#execution]]

####supportFloatingPanel()
Function should return `true` for Floating Trading Panel to be displayed.

####supportBottomWidget()
Function should return `true` for Bottom Trading Panel to be displayed.

####buttonDropdownItems()
Bottom Trading Panel has a button with a list of dropdown items. This function is expected to return an array of [[ActionMetainfo|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#actionmetainfo]], each of them representing one dropdown item.

####chartContextMenuItems(e)
Chart can have a sub-menu `Trading` in the context menu. Return the list of items for a sub-menu. Format is the same as for `buttonDropdownItems`.

`e` is a context object passed by a broswer

####bottomContextMenuItems()
Bottom Trading Panel can have a context menu. Return a list of items for this menu. Format is the same as for `buttonDropdownItems`.

####isTradable(symbol)
This function is required for the Floating Trading Panel. Ability to trade via the panel depends on the result of this function: `true` or `false`. You don't need to imlement this method if all the symbols can be traded.

####createBottomWidget(container)
This function is called when it is needed to create a Bottom Trading Panel. You should create DOM object and append it to the `container`. The container shows a vertical scroll bar when it is needed.

####accountManagerInfo()
This function is called when supportCustomBottomWidget is false. It should return information that will be used to build an account manager.
See [[Account Manager]] for more information.

####showOrderDialog([[order|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order]])
This function is invoked by the chart when user requests to create or modify an order.

So we give you the ability to use your own dialog and it's 100% up to you how to manage it.

####placeOrder([[order|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order]], silently)

Method is invoked when a user want to place an order. Order is pre-filled with partial or full information.
If `silently` is `true` no order dialog show be shown.

####modifyOrder([[order|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order]], silently, focus)
1. `order` is an order object to modify 
2. `silently` - if it is `true` no order dialog show be shown
3. `focus` - [[Focus constant|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#focusoptions]]. It can be already initialized by the chart.

Method is invoked when a user want to modify an existing order.

#### cancelOrder(orderId, silently)
This method is invoked to cancel single order with given `id`.
If `silently` is `true` no dialogs show be shown.

#### cancelOrders(symbol, side, ordersIds, silently)
1. `symbol` - symbol string
2. `side`: `"sell"` or `"buy"`
3. `ordersIds` - ids already collected by `symbol` and `side`
If `silently` is `true` no dialogs show be shown.

This method is invoked to cancel multiple orders for a `symbol` and `side`.

####editPositionBrackets(positionId, focus)
This method is invoked if `supportBrackets` configuration flag is on to display a dialog for editing of take profit and stop loss.
1. `positionId` is ID of existing position to be modified
2. `focus` - [[Focus constant|Trading-Objects-and-Constants#focusoptions]].

####closePosition(positionId, silently)
This method is invoked if `supportClosePosition` configuration flag is on to close the position by id.
If `silently` is `true` no dialogs show be shown.

####reversePosition(positionId, silently)
This method is invoked if `supportReversePosition` configuration flag is on to reverse the position by id.
If `silently` is `true` no dialogs show be shown.

#### symbolInfo(symbol) : Deferred (or Promise)
1. `symbol` - symbol string

This method is invoked by the internal Order Dialog, DOM panel and floating trading panel to get symbol information.
Result is an object with the following data:
- `qty` - object with fields `min`, `max` and `step` that specifies Quantity field step and boundaries.
- `pipSize` - size of 1 pip (e.g., 0.0001 for EURUSD)
- `pipValue` - values of 1 pip in account currency (e.g., 1 for EURUSD for an account in USD)
- `minTick` - minimal price change (e.g., 0.00001 for EURUSD). It is used for price fields.
- `description` - a description to be displayed in the dialog
- `type` - instrument type, only `forex` matters - it enables negative pips check in the order dialog

#### accountInfo() : Deferred (or Promise)

This method is invoked by the internal Order Dialog to get account information.
It should return only one field for now:
1. currencySign: string - which is a sign of acccount currency

#### subscribePL(positionId)

Method should be implemented if `supportPLUpdate` config flag is `true`.
Since this method is called the broker should provide profit/loss via [[plUpdate|Trading-Host#plupdatepositionid-pl]] method.

#### unsubscribePL(positionId)

Method should be implemented if `supportPLUpdate` config flag is `true`.
Since this method is called the broker should stop providing profit/loss.

#### subscribeEquity()

Method should be implemented if you use standard order dialog and support stop loss.
Since this method is called the broker should provide equity updates via [[equityUpdate|Trading-Host#equityupdateequity]] method.

#### unsubscribeEquity()

Method should be implemented if you use standard order dialog and support stop loss.
Since this method is called the broker should stop providing equity updates.

And this is it !
