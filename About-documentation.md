# About documentation

The Charting Library is under intensive development, so some things may change very fast. Different parts of this document have different stability: some are rather stable and others may change every day, or several times a day. We marked each document section with its stability estimate. We use following marks:

|Value|Meaning|
------|-------
0 (unstable)|Extremely unstable. Preliminary information. May be changed or removed at any moment.
1 (under development)|Under development. Implemented, but may be changed.
2 (rather stable)|Rather stable. Will be changed only if really necessary, but may be extended (without removing/changing the existing stuff). Chance of changing is low.
3 (stable)|Stable. Chance of changing is very low.

This document also describes Trading Terminal API, which has much in common with Charting Library API. Trading Terminal specific parts have been marked with **TT** token.

Additionally, we use **obsolete(\<version1\> - \<version2\>)** mark for stuff, which has been deprecated and not recommended to use. The stuff marked with this label is treated as obsolete from **version1** and will be removed in **version2**.

If you want to use the Charting Library, but this document does not answer your questions, feel free to contact us.
